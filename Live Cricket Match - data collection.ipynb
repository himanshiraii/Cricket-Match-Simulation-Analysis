    "> * Firstly, you will be asked to choose your PLAYING 11 from the squad of 15, where you will enter only the jersey numbers of the players who will be playing the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "> * After playing 11 has been selected, and since this code records batting side of a team, so next step is to select the OPENING PLAYERS of the team. (Imp-Everytime a player is choosen, his JERSEY NUMBER has to be the input and not his name)\n",
    "\n",
    "> * And now the game begins by bowling the very first ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "> * BALL TYPE - Now at every ball, the first thing which will be asked would be if the ball is a fair ball(f), wide(w), no ball(n) or a ball which includes just some extra runs(e). \n",
    "\n",
    "> * STRIKE - As soon as you ans which type of ball was bowled, the player who played that ball will be asked, so you will have to input that player's jersey number.\n",
    "\n",
    "> * RUNS FORMAT & WICKET - Then input the runs hit by that player. Eq: write 1 if he ran a single or a 6 if he hit a six. (Imp - Numbers ranging from 0-6 are reserved for runs whereas numbers like 7,8,9 if inputted into runs scored will lead to a \"wicket\".)\n",
    "\n",
    "> * WICKET - And since numbers 7/8/9 will be appended into the ball wise score, that row in the data will have to be removed later otherwise it will generate wrong results. Also, due to some last minute changes, you will get a different row for the wicket ball. (you will understand it better when applied practically). Final result will lead to 2 rows, one with runs equal to 7/8/9 and wicket=no and other row with wicket=yes. So, in post analysis you will need to drop first row (with runs=7/8/9) and keep the second one only.\n",
    "\n",
    "> * WICKET - There is one more thing which will be asked when a wicket fells, which is \"Runs along with wicket\", it has been put for a case if runs are also scored along with wicket because \"Runs scored will record the wicket (as designed and explained above)\" and \"runs along with wicket\" will record runs, if nothing scored, then simpy type 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "> * WICKET - Then input next player's jersey number who comes after the wicket falls.\n",
    "\n",
    "> * WIDE/NOBALL - in this case after ball type is asked and \"w\" or \"n\" has been inputted, the first thing that will be asked is \"w/n runs\" for the extra runs that will be added when a wide/noball is bowled and I introduced this step because sometime on such balls not only a single run is added(extra) but more than 1 run situation can also happen,that's why it has been inducted in the model. So input runs keeping in mind that 1 run has to be typed in along with other runs, if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "> * WIDE/NOBALL - Then comes a situation when more than one wide/noballs are bowled, and for that \"w/n again? (y/n)\" feature was put in. If yes, input y and if no, input n and follow further steps asked. \n",
    "\n",
    "> * WIDE/NOBALL - And later on if no more wide/noballs are not bowled after one has been done, the next ball is a legal ball hence \"Runs scored\" will be asked for the legal ball's score.\n",
    "\n",
    "> * End - Input \"end\" in ball type when the match gets over before all the overs have been bowled. Eq: target acheived in 45 overs in a 50 over game with 5 overs left, the team gets all out before overs gets completed, etc."
